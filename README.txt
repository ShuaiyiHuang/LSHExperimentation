I implement LSH based on random projection with matlab and conduct experiments.Anyone can repeat the experiments easily.


1.Environment requirement:Win7 32bit and Matlab2014a

2.SIFT1M and GIST1M Dataset download:http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr

3.Run Main.m directly.

Please pay attention to path of dataset folders.You can modify path in Main.m.
